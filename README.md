# Parantez Simple [Virgol.io](https://virgool.io/) REST API with Nest.js and TypeScript

Description
This project aims to create a simple REST API using Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework. We’ll build an efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side application that exposes RESTful endpoints.

Features
Nest.js Framework: We’ll leverage Nest.js for its modular architecture, TypeScript support, and powerful CLI.
REST API: We’ll create endpoints for common CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
TypeScript: The entire project will be written in TypeScript.
Documentation: We’ll include relevant information about the API, endpoints, and usage instructions in the README.
